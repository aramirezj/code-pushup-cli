## Getting started

## Knip CodePushup reporter

The plugin maintains a [custom knip reporter](./src/lib/reporter/reporter.ts) to produce the audit outputs. It is used internally, but is also exported for public use.

_Use custom reporter manually:_

```bash
npx knip --reporter=./dist/packages/plugin-knip/reporter.js
```

The reporter also accepts options in for of a JSON string.

_Use custom reporter options:_

```bash
npx knip --reporter=./dist/packages/plugin-knip/reporter.js  --reporter-options='{"outputFile":".code-pushup/knip/knip.report.json","rawOutputFile":".code-pushup/knip/knip.raw.report.json", "verbose": true}'
```
